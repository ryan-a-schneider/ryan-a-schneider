### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ryan Schneider, and I'm a fifth-year Clinical Psychology PhD candidate at Montclair State University. As a member of Dr. Zottoli's [Legal Decision-Making Lab]([url](https://www.msudecisionmakinglab.com/)), I research the factors underlying false guilty pleas and the decision-making process of defendants faced with plea bargains. For my dissertation, I have also started to branch out into prosecutor decision-making as well.
