### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ryan Schneider, and I'm a Clinical Psychology PhD candidate at Montclair State University. As a member of Dr. Zottoli's [Legal Decision-Making Lab](https://www.msudecisionmakinglab.com/), I research the factors underlying false guilty pleas and the decision-making process of defendants faced with plea bargains. For my dissertation, I have also started to branch out into prosecutor decision-making as well.
